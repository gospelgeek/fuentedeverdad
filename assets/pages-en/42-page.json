In order for the missionary to be successful in his work, he must be anointed and sent.<br><br>Our God manifested Himself as the Messiah to heal the damage that sin had caused in man; this work can be found in great detail in the verses written above, take note of the verbs; <i>preach, bind, proclaim, comfort, appoint.</i><br><br>Due to the fact that sin brings poverty, He preached the good news to the poor. Due to the fact that sin breaks hearts, He came to bind those of a broken heart. Due to the fact that sin drives one to prison, He came to proclaim liberty to the captives. Due to the fact that sin oppresses, He came to proclaim the year of the good will of the Lord. Due to the fact that sin is a crime that needs to be avenged, He came to proclaim the day of vengeance of our Lord.<br><br>The prophecy was given, Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of this prophecy, He was anointed and sent, He preached, binded, proclaimed, comforted, appointed, left us the best example and now He asks His church to keep doing these works; He anointed us, pouring His Spirit in us and has sent us, like Paul says in his second letter to the Corinthians in chapter 6 verse 1, <i>“We then, as workers together with him…”</i><br><br>The best way to give glory to God and to thank Him for the liberty in which he has set us free, is to continue working to see <i>Every Heart Healed.</i><br><br><b>From Pastor Martin Perez</b>"
