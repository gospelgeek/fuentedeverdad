This course presented us with a very simple and practical way on how to plant a home church through discipleship.<br><br>We were challenged to keep moving forward with the great commission. We had the opportunity to have time to learn, share experiences, prayer time, be ministered, and to partake of the Holy Supper, Communion, as a church.<br><br>On Sunday, April 17, during our launch celebration, the Lord permitted us to open our doors as a community church with a meeting place. We had the blessing to receive greetings and a message of blessing from our Bishop Samuel Valverde.<br><br>We also received a very inspired word from the message of the Sermon on the Mount, “The Beatitudes”, and how it relates to our vision of seeing Every Heart Healed.<br><br>Pastor Ramon Mendoza made a very special prayer to declare the launch of FTC SLP. We believe that it was a very special time that God granted us to unite as a church and to start seeing the fulfillments of promises that God has for us.<br><br><i>Written by Pastor Gabriel A. Galvez F.</i>"
