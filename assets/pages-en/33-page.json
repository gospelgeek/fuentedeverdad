It is very important to listen when God is asking you to speak a word unto someone. That person knows God hears them because God uses you to speak life into someone’s marriage or situation.

The Spirit of the Lord united us in a very impactful way; we cried, we hugged, and even though we couldn’t really communicate, the Lord united us in one spirit. The worship with music from Cambodia took me to a higher place, and the Lord would show me that the difference in language was not a barrier to praise him.<br><br>Another experience that impacted me was the unity that was between the brethren of Fountain of Truth. Even though some of us didn’t know each other, we were still able to connect in one same spirit with a heart of service and were able to give our best effort. To be able to share with the kids and families of the villages and to help with the necessities from our brethren there, truly was a great blessing to our heart.<br><br>The lesson for my life in this missionary trip, is to value day by day all the blessings that God has granted us, and above all to show my daughters and family how blessed we really are. Many times we complain and demand so much, when other people conform with what they have without complaining about anything. This trip also has taught me to keep supporting our missions and to motivate others to support our missionary works."
