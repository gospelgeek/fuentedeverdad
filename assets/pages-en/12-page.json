            "content": "The reports of the incredible weekend kept coming. Some spoke enthusiastically about one service, others, with no less emotion, about the next. For some, it was this preaching, and for others, the altar time that followed it. Everyone, from experienced ministers to new converts, said they received something very special. Time after time they mentioned a common factor… God visited us.<br><br><b>What is The Outpouring?</b><br><br>God’s promise in Joel 2:28 that in the last days He would pour out His Spirit began its fulfillment on the Day of Pentecost when, for the first time, everyone in a group of believers received the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–4). Since Jesus taught that the entrance into the kingdom of heaven required being “born of water and of the Spirit” (John 3:5), and that the initial sign of receiving His Spirit is speaking in tongues (Acts 2, 10, 19), and event focused on this wonderful experience could not be absent in an Apostolic church.<br><br>The Outpouring, then, has the purpose of enabling three extremely important objectives, considering the first as essential to the existence of this conference:<ol><li>That those who have never received the baptism of the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues may receive it (Acts 2:1–4).</li><li>That the believers that have already received the Spirit may renew their experience, being filled with the Holy Spirit once again (Acts 4:29–31).</li><li>To promote and atmosphere where the miraculous gifts of the Spirit may be manifested and operate for the benefit of the church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:4–11).</li></ol><b>What happened at The Outpouring 2022 </b><br><br>Of course, a conference that prioritizes the presence of the Holy Spirit will have other benefits: Fellowship with Brothers and Sisters from different churches, from various states of the American union, along with visitors from other countries; the missionary zeal that was born in many hearts; the youth who visited the altar night after night and left filled with God’s presence; visitors that felt, for the first time, the presence of a real and living God; the ministers and ministries that were energized to reach the world with the Gospel.<br><br>Perhaps the main characteristic of The Outpouring 2022 was the clear call of God to return to holiness, to honoring the presence of a holy God in spirit, conduct, and even dress, just as it was at the dawn of our Pentecostal movement. Our leaders replied in the affirmative, with a commitment to preach and teach the Word without compromise.Because of all of this, we anticipate an even more powerful move of God in the future, and everyone who was present have already made plans to not miss the next Outpouring.<br><br><b><i>Written by Dean and Minister G.Jorge Medina </i></b>"

One of the highlights of the conference for me was to see the unity displayed among the ministry. Every minister was present, not only in body, but also in focus. Additionally, there was a desire in each minister I was blessed to communicate with to see the Fountain of Truth ministry develop into a great platform that brings glory to God.<br><br>The excitement was palpable and there were people who arrived to the evening services who still had red eyes from pouring their hearts out in the morning sessions.<br><br>Overall, this was an amazing experience and I hope to be blessed enough to be part of it again this year. <br><br><b><i>Pastor & Evangelist Loammi Diaz</i></b>"
